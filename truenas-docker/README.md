# TrueNAS Docker Environment

Required OS: Ubuntu

To setup the environment for the first time (as root):

`curl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfugate1/server-management/main/truenas-docker/setup.sh | sudo bash`

After initial setup, Jenkins will automatically update the environment when changes are detected.
